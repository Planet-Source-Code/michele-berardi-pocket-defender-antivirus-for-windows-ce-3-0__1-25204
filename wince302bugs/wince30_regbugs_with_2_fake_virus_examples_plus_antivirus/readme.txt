you use this software at your own risk,


this software documents 2 bugs that i've found on windows ce 3.0 systems:


I've written 2 simple software using Embedded visual Basic 3.0:


that exploits these bugs and a simple "antivirus" :


that restore the original system settings



how to try this software:


1. 


first of all compile & install on target machine :


PocketDefender.rar


anf than try to compile and execute on target machine:


  Giamaica.rar      (if you set this key with non standard value and then you select
                     a configured RAS , the system will fail and you must reset the pocket pc.)

GiamaicaII.rar     (settings these keyes with non standard value cause the impossibility to connect
                    the pocket machine with a desktop machine.)


after the execution of these files


execute (the previously installed...) on target machine:


pocketdefender.vb



and than recover the system.
